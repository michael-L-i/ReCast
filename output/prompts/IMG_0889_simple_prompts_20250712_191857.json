    "raw_prompt": "A young man stands on a green lawn, smiling and holding a red can. A young woman walks into the frame, points at the can, and then takes it from him. She smiles at the camera while holding the can. The man then says something to her, and the woman quickly walks out of frame to the left, taking the can with her, as the man watches her go. The scene takes place outdoors with a large tree, green bushes, and a gravel path visible in the background.",
    "anime_prompt": "The scene opens on a lush, emerald lawn, bathed in the soft, golden light of a perfect afternoon. In the background, an ancient, sprawling tree casts dappled shadows, its leaves a vibrant tapestry of green, while meticulously kept bushes shimmer with life beside a gleaming white gravel path, all imbued with an almost dreamlike clarity.\n\nA bright-eyed young man, with a gentle, genuine smile that seems to warm the very air around him, stands gracefully on the grass. He holds a vibrantly red can, almost glowing with a faint inner light, his fingers lightly curled around it.\n\nSuddenly, an effervescent young woman glides into the frame from the right, her movements fluid and light, almost as if she's dancing on air. Her eyes sparkle with playful mischief as she points a slender, graceful finger directly at the red can, a mischievous grin playing on her lips. With a swift, almost imperceptible motion, she plucks the can from his hand, her fingers brushing his in a fleeting, gentle contact.\n\nTurning slightly, she flashes a dazzling, confident smile towards the 'camera,' the red can held triumphantly aloft, a subtle, almost ethereal shimmer around her. The young man utters something, his brow furrowing slightly in playful protest. Before he can react further, the young woman, a blur of motion and joyful energy, pivots swiftly and darts off to the left, disappearing from the frame in a flurry of movement, the gleaming red can still clutched in her hand. The young man watches her go, a tender, wistful smile replacing his playful frown, a faint spark of light reflecting in his eyes as she vanishes, leaving only the gentle hum of the idyllic setting behind.",
    "space_prompt": "Cadet Jax stands on the verdant hydro-deck of the orbital station 'Sanctuary Prime,' a genuine smile creasing his lips as he clutches a sleek, luminescent red bio-canister. Pilot Kael glides into the sensor's view from an adjoining metallic corridor, her finger quickly tapping her wrist-mounted datapad as she gestures at the canister, then deftly plucks it from his grasp. A mischievous grin flashes across her face, directed squarely at the nearest surveillance drone, as she secures the shimmering container. Jax transmits a quick, unheard query to her comm-unit, but Kael merely boosts her low-grav boots, quickly jetting out of the left quadrant of the biodome, the bio-canister clutched triumphantly, as Jax watches her receding form. The entire scene unfolds within the colossal, crystalline dome, where towering bio-engineered flora stretch towards simulated stellar light, dense, glowing xenobush clusters line the perimeters, and a permeable nan-gravel path winds through the artificial landscape."
